{"name":"Scaley","tagline":"Scaley - see, create, automate  public and private cloud resources","body":"### Scaley \r\nThe goal of this project is to provide a solution for managing multiple cloud presences. With the ability to quickly display resources within a dashboard across varying public and private cloud providers, provide analytical/statistic data, and as a stretch goal migrations from one provider to another. \r\n\r\n### Underlying stack\r\nThe underlying stack will be written in python (using the flask framework), jquery/css, and jinja templating. \r\n\r\n### Current state \r\nCurrently the app is under a fresh re-write. The project was initially started as a private repository. However the first milestone is to use apache-libcloud and sort through any unusual return types so we can consistently display data via a jinja templating. The configuration concept is there. As of right now the concepts are implemented. 7/30/15 is the target date for the first working initial proof of concept. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@ieldib islam.eldib@gmail.com \r\n\r\n### How you can contribute\r\nYou can contact @ieldib for more information.
